//execUserPreload       Called after communication with the target system is established
//                      but before downloading the target application.
//                      Implement this macro to initialize memory locations and/or
//                      registers which are vital for loading data properly.
//execUserFlashInit     Called once before the flash loader is downloaded to RAM.
//                      Implement this macro typically for setting up the memory map
//                      required by the flash loader. This macro is only called when you are
//                      programming flash, and it should only be used for flash loader
//                      functionality.
//execUserSetup         Called once after the target application is downloaded.
//                      Implement this macro to set up the memory map, breakpoints,
//                      interrupts, register macro files, etc.
//execUserFlashReset    Called once after the flash loader is downloaded to RAM, but
//                      before execution of the flash loader. This macro is only called when
//                      you are programming flash, and it should only be used for flash
//                      loader functionality.
//execUserReset         Called each time the reset command is issued.
//                      Implement this macro to set up and restore data.
//execUserExit          Called once when the debug session ends.
//                      Implement this macro to save status data etc.
//execUserFlashExit     Called once when the debug session ends.
//                      Implement this macro to save status data etc. This macro is useful
//                      for flash loader functionality.
